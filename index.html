        <h1>A Page Designed to Be Read Aloud</h1>

        <p>
            This is a simple demonstration page. It has been created with a specific structure to make it easy for Google Chrome's "Listen to this page" feature to work. The feature looks for pages that are structured like articles or blog posts.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main elements that help are a clear title, a main heading like the one above, and several paragraphs of text like this one. By wrapping the content in an "article" tag and using standard paragraph tags, we are giving the browser a clear signal about what the main content is.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In contrast, a page with only a few links, a complex layout with many columns, or interactive content like a social media feed would likely not show the "Listen to this page" option. The browser's AI wouldn't know where the main story begins or ends.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the final paragraph. If you are viewing this on Chrome for Android, you should be able to tap the three-dot menu and see the option to listen to this content.
