            <p>
                This webpage is specifically designed to be compatible with the "Listen to this page" feature in Google Chrome for Android. If you are viewing this page on a live web server (not as a local file), the option should be available in the menu.

            <h2>Why Structure Matters</h2>

            <p>
                The feature relies on an algorithm that identifies "article-like" content. It looks for clear signals like a main heading (H1 tag), subheadings (H2 tags), and substantial paragraphs of text (P tags). By using semantic HTML like <code><article></code> and <code><main></code>, we give the browser strong hints about which part of the page is the primary content to be read.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is why the feature often fails on homepages, search results, or social media feeds. Those pages are collections of links and snippets, not a single, cohesive narrative. The algorithm gets confused and doesn't know what to read.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Confirmation</h2>
            
            <p>
                This paragraph serves as additional text to ensure the page is long enough to be considered a full article. Having a sufficient amount of content is another key factor. If everything has worked correctly, you can now enjoy having this text read to you by your browser.
